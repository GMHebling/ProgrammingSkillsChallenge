# Geral
The codes can be compiled with "gcc -o saida codigo.c"
All programs were tested locally and using https://onlinegdb.com/

## Questao 3
Loop from 1 to 100.
The code checks each number for a multiple of 3/5 using the modulo operation (%)
If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, prints the number.

## Questao 4
Code first checks the size of each string (s and t). If one is bigger than the other then it's necessary to perform as many operations as the difference in size between the strings.
After that, the code checks each element of the smaller string with the other string. For each different ellement between then, 2 operations are necessary: a remove and a concat.
Finally, the number k is compared with the minimum number of operations calculated in the previous steps.
## Questao 5
Unit test with an example from the question to assert the output.

## Questao 6
Tables were created using the date provided. The query can be run in https://sqliteonline.com/.
The query is a JOIN of the table students with notes. A BETWEEN is used to find the appropriad grade to each value. A CASE statement is used to output NULL when the grade is below 8.

## Questao 7
Since there are two methods with the same names that probably have different parameters, is seems that this is an example of "Method Overload"
## Questao 8
Since both tables have the same Schema, a union is used to combine them and a SELECT DISTINC return unique values of the column Name.
## Questao 9
Application of command listed on the table to perform the tasks.
## Questao 10
Code checks each element of the string until it finds the termination char '\0'.
The number of element until '\0' is the lenght of the string.

## Questao 11
Using the previous function, the lenght of string is obtained. After that, code prints the string from last to first element, reversing it.
